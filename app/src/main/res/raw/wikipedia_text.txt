Android is a <a href=#>mobile operating system</a> developed by <a href=#>Google</a>, based on a modified version of the <a href=#>Linux kernel</a> and other 
<a href=#>open source</a> software and designed primarily for <a href=#>touchscreen</a> mobile devices such as <a href=#>smartphones</a> and <a href=#>tablets</a>. In addition, Google has further 
developed <a href=#>Android TV</a> for televisions, <a href=#>Android Auto</a> for cars, and <a href=#>Wear OS</a> for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. 
Variants of Android are also used on <a href=#>game consoles</a>, <a href=#>digital cameras</a>, <a href=#>PCs</a> and other electronics.  Initially developed by Android Inc., 
which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the <a href=#>first commercial Android device</a> launched in September 2008. 
The operating system has since gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being <a href=#>9.0 &quot;Pie&quot;</a>, 
released in August 2018. The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and is primarily licensed under
 the <a href=#>Apache License</a>.  Android is also associated with a suite of <a href=#>proprietary software</a> developed by Google, including core apps for services 
 such as <a href=#>Gmail</a> and <a href=#>Google Search</a>, as well as the <a href=#>application store</a> and <a href=#>digital distribution</a> platform Google Play, and associated <a href=#>development 
 platform</a>. These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google, but AOSP has been used as
 the basis of competing Android ecosystems, such as <a href=#>Amazon.com</a>'s <a href=#>Fire OS</a>, which use their own equivalents to the <a href=#>Google Mobile Services</a>. 
 Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2017, it has over two billion 
 monthly active users, the largest <a href=#>installed base</a> of any operating system, and as of June 2018, the <a href=#>Google Play</a> store features over 3.3 million apps.
